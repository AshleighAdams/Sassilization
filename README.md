# Sassilization

After being up for many years and having many problems in those years, Sassilization has decided it's best to shut down its servers. The forums are going to remain hosted upon the request of many regular users.

Since the servers were shut down, the developers thought it would best to release STGamemodes so all the hard work would not go to waste. You can find the release topic here.

Thanks for sticking with Sassilization through everything and we hope to continue seeing all of you around. Perhaps even see you on Sassilization servers again some day.

With love,
The Sassilization Team
